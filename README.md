# Conlang Analysis

Constructed languages ("conlangs") are artificially created languages, typically created as a part of larger fictional projects or purely for entertainment. The `r/conlangs` community is a forum hosted by Reddit dedicated to provide a community where people can share their own conlangs and discuss the hobby in general. This is a project intended to track and analyze trends within the `r/conlangs` community, with a focus on the popularity of different types of posts and how it has changed over time. This project seeks to ingest and analyze trends end-to-end, starting with taking data from the Reddit API and putting it through a full data engineering-to-analysis-to-modeling/presentation pipeline. At the time of writing, it is still under development.
