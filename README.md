# Conlang Analysis

Constructed languages ("conlangs") are artificially created languages, typically created as a part of larger fictional projects or purely for entertainment. The [Conlang Database](https://database.conlang.org/search/) is a database where language constructors can record and document their languages in a centralized area. This project seeks to ingest and analyze trends end-to-end, starting with taking data from the database itself and putting it through a full data engineering-to-analysis-to-modeling/presentation pipeline. At the time of writing, it is still under development.
